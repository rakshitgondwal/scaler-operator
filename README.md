# scaler-operator


## Description
Can be used to scale deployments

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running this locally

-   ```
    make manifests
    ```

-   ```
    kubectl apply -f config/crd/bases/api.rakshitgondwal.online_scalers.yaml
    ```

- Run a `nginx` deployment on your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
    ```
**Run the following command to check for the number of replicas running right now**(Should be 1)
```
kubectl get pods
```

**Run the following commands to scale up the replicas**
-   ```
    make run
    ```
- To be done in other terminal
    ```
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/api_v1alpha1_scaler.yaml
    ```

**You can now check the number of replicas using the following command**(Should be 5)
```
kubectl get pods
```
